Day 1, 12/09/24

Today I worked on my function part of my final project, creating a function that produces possible dum dum combinations. I mainly did this using a list that had all my flavors, counters for each flavor, and a for loop that used range (amount of dum dums), and used random.randint to randomize the dum dum flavors.  

I decided to start with the function part since I know more and didn't have to learn a completely new topic, like I will for when making my GUI. Also, once it understands how to make a GUI, having my code for the function part done will be super helpful! I might find an easier way to keep track of the amount of each flavor as the random.randint generates a number corresponding to a flavor. Currently, I am using multiple counters. It's not a bad way to do it but since there are 16 flavors, I do have 16 counters. I think In the coming days, as I am learning about GUIs, if I get a chance or want to take a break from GUIs, I can revisit my counters. I felt pretty good writing my code since it mainly involved things we covered earlier in the year and I was really happy to see my idea start to come to life!
