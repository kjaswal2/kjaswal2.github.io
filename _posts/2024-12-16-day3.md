Day 3, 12/16/24

Today I spent more time with my GUI. I ended up deciding to just use Gradio to create my interface but it offers what I want and I would rather spend more time making my Gradio interface unique and special, than trying out a whole new program to make my GUI and have it be basic and plain because of time. I spent some time working with customizing my interface, changing the color, seeing how the results are displayed and more. I also tried to add an image to my interface and it worked but not fully, so that is something I am going to explore more tomorrow. 

I am also going to try and test out different input boxes for my interface. Because right now I have a simple number box where the user can input a number and then press calculate. I might try using a slider where they can slide the dot to the number they want to input. I think Gradio has many cool and unique features that I can spend the last few days testing out. 

I really enjoy working with Gradio because I feel like their website that explains many of their features is also very detailed, and helps me understand how to incorporate certain things into my interface. It also provides many examples that are very helpful to see since I haven't worked that much with Gradio
