Day 4, 12/18/24

For the past two days, I customized my Gradio and worked on test cases for my function. 

I tried adding in a sliding bar as the input bar so the user can move the dot around to get the number they want. I was able to add it in but I felt like it was harder 
to use than just typing in the number. So, I went back to having the input by adding a textbox. I did like the idea of a number slider though, I was also happy to see 
Gradio offered multiple input options. 

For my test cases, I ran into some problems. For gradio to return the results, its formatted as a return statement that returns f-strings. When you use the gradio 
interface, it is displayed correctly, however when you call the function itself in colab, it returns a string that's not formatted correctly. Since my function also relies
on user input and randomness, I am not completely sure. I am going to wait on doing my test cases until tomorrow morning! 

I also worked on my presentation, explaining my project, what I did, what I learned, etc.
