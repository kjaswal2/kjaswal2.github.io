## About Me

I am Krishna Jaswal! I am currently a sophomore in highschool. I love Dum Dums! I am also currently learning Python!

## About My Project

My final project is calculating the possible combination of Dum Dum flavors in a bag based on how much it weighs (pounds) and creating a GUI to display the function. The interface asks the user to input a number of pounds and returns possible combinations of flavors!
